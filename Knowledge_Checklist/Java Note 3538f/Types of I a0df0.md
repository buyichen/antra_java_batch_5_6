# Types of Inheritance

- **Single**
In Single Inheritance, one class extends another class (one class only).
- **Multiple (Java does not support)**
Multiple Inheritance is one of the inheritance in Java types where one class extending more than one class. Java does not support multiple inheritance due to the [diamond problem](Types%20of%20I%20a0df0/Diamond%20Pr%2093954.md).
- **Multilevel**
In Multilevel Inheritance, one class can inherit from a derived class. Hence, the derived class becomes the base class for the new class.
- **Hierarchy**
In Hierarchy Inheritance, one class is inherited by many sub classes.
- **Hybrid (Java does not support)**
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of Single and Multiple inheritance which is not supported in Java.
