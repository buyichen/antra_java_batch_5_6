# Implementations of Deque

**ArrayDeque** is the implementation of Deque interface which provide a way to apply resizable-array. ArrayDeque is for Array Double Ended Queue which allow users to add or remove an element from both sides of the queue. Thus, we can use it as Queue or Stack, for traversing it we still need iterate the array because is base on the list structure.
