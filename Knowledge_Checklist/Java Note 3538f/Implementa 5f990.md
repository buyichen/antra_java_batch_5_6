# Implementations of Set

- **HashSet**: 
HashSet represents the collection that uses a hash table data structure for storage. Hashing is used to store the elements in the HashSet. HashSet contains unique items.
- **LinkedHashSet**: 
LinkedHashSet extends the HashSet class which have the similar functionality but it also maintains a doubly-linked list data structure for storing the elements. Therefore, it can remain the insertion order. LinkedHashSet permits null elements.
