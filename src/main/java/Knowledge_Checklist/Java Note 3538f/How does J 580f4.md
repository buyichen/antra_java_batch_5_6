# How does Java implement Polymorphism?

Java implements polymorphism in two ways:

- Static or compile-time polymorphism is done by method overloading (many method share same name with different parameter)
- Dynamic or runtime polymorphism is done by method overriding (defining a method in the child class which has the same name and same parameters as in the parent class)
