# Exception Handling

1. `try`: The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
2. `catch`: The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
3. `finally`: Finally is used in Java exception handling, normally placed after the catch block. It will always be executed no matter if the exception is handled or not.
4. `throw`: The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code. We can throw either checked or unchecked exception. The throw keyword is mainly used to throw custom exceptions.
5. `throws`: throws is a keyword in Java which is used in the signature of method to indicate that this method might throw one of the listed type exceptions. The caller to these methods has to handle the exception using a try-catch block.
6. `assert`: **`assert`**is a Java keyword used to define an *assert statement*. An assert statement is used to declare an expected boolean condition in a program. If the program is running with assertions enabled, then the condition is checked at runtime. If the condition is false, the Java runtime system throws an AssertionError.
