# Eight Basic Data Types

1. `byte`: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive).
2. `short`: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).
3. `int`: By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of $-2^{31}$ and a maximum value of $2^{31}-1$.
4. `long`: The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of $-2^{63}$ and a maximum value of $2^{63}-1$.
5. `float`: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
6. `double`: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
7. `char`: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of `'\u0000'`(or 0) and a maximum value of `'\uffff'`(or 65,535 inclusive).
8. `boolean`: The boolean data type has only two possible values: `true`and `false`. Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. This data type represents one bit of information, but its "size" isn't something that's precisely defined.
