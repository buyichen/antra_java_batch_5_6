# How Is HashMap Implemented in Java? How Does Its Implementation Use hashCode and equals Methods of Objects? What Is the Time Complexity of Putting and Getting an Element from Such Structure?

`HashMap`is basically an array of linked list. HashMap use hashCode() to compute the hash value of the provided key, then find the index of the array (bucket) to insert the value as a node of linked list for resolving the hash collision. Before the insertion, HashMap will use the equals() method to compare the head of linked list, if there node have same values, the old node will be replaced by the new node. Otherwise, the new node directly be inserted as the head of linked list. For put(), the time complexity is always O(1) because it is a array random access. However, for get(), the worst case would be O(n), if all the node are having hash collision. In average, it should be O(1).
