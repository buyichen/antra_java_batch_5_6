# Flow Control

1. `if`: In Java, the "if" statement is used to evaluate a condition. The control of the program is diverted depending upon the specific condition. The condition of the If statement gives a Boolean value, either true or false.
2. `else`: The if-else statement is an extension to the if-statement, which uses another block of code, i.e., else block. The else block is executed if the condition of the if-block is evaluated as false.
3. `switch`: The switch statement contains multiple blocks of code called cases and a single case is executed based on the variable which is being switched.
4. `case`: The case keyword marks a block of code in a switch statement.
5. `default`: The default keyword the default block of code in a switch statement. The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match in the switch.
6. `for`: For loop enables us to initialize the loop variable, check the condition, and increment/decrement in a single line of code. We use the for loop only when we exactly know the number of times, we want to execute the block of code.
7. `do`: The do-while loop checks the condition at the end of the loop after executing the loop statements. When the number of iteration is not known and we have to execute the loop at least once, we can use do-while loop.
8. `while`: The while loop is also used to iterate over the number of statements multiple times. However, if we don't know the number of iterations in advance, it is recommended to use a while loop. Unlike for loop, the initialization and increment/decrement doesn't take place inside the loop statement in while loop.
9. `break`: The break statement is used to break the current flow of the program and transfer the control to the next statement outside a loop or switch statement. However, it breaks only the inner loop in the case of the nested loop.
10. `continue`: The continue statement skips the specific part of the loop and jumps to the next iteration of the loop immediately.
11. `return`: Java return keyword is used to complete the execution of a method. The return followed by the appropriate value that is returned to the caller. This value depends on the method return type like int method always return an integer value.
