# Implementations of Queue

- **PriorityQueue:**
PriorityQueue class which is implemented in the collection framework provides us a way to process the objects based on the priority. It is known that a queue follows First-In-First-Out algorithm, but sometimes the elements of the queue are needed to be processed according to the priority, that’s when the PriorityQueue comes into play.
- **LinkedList:**
LinkedList is a class which is implemented in the collection framework which inherently implements the linked list data structure. It is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays or queues.
