# Object

### What is Object in Java and why do we need Object?

Object is an instance of Java. An object is made from data and procedures associate with the actual data. An object has a state and behavior where the state is stored in fields (variables), the behavior is functionated by methods (functions).
Object make the programming language more human nature, thus, it more easy to understanding and efficient on reusability. In Java, since Java is a OOP programming language, objects are required because they can created to call a non-static function which are not present inside the Main Method but present inside the Class and also provide the name to the space which is being used to store the data.
