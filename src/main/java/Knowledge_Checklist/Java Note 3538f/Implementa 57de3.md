# Implementation of SortedSet

- **TreeSet**: 
TreeSet is implementation of SortedSet Interface, a interface that extended from Set interface. It uses a tree for storage. Like HashSet, TreeSet also contains unique elements. The different is the access and retrieval time is faster by TreeSet due to the tree data structure which take average in O(logn) time. The elements in TreeSet stored in ascending order.
